Windows NT is a Microsoft Windows personal 
computer operating system designed for users 
and businesses needing advanced capability. 
NT's technology is the base for the Microsoft 
successor operating system, Windows 2000. Windows NT
(which may originally have stood for "New Technology,"
although Microsoft doesn't say) is actually two products: 
Microsoft NT Workstation and Microsoft NT Server.
