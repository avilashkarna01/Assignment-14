source to destination via 
communication channel.
Explain with block diagram ? 			
What is Amplitude Modulation. 
Explain the frequency 
spectrum of a Sine Wave
X(c)=co?st with a high carrier 
modulated wave ? Explain
why we need of modulation ?									
Show that 2/3 of the total 
power are required to 
transmit
the carrier ?
